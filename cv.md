### About:
*Dear Guest,*

*Thank you for looking at my CV. At the moment it is part of an assignment in a course I am studying, but I hope that the next time you visit me, the CV will be more professional).*

*My dream is to become a really in-demand developer, and I'm on my way to that goal right now:
I'm successfully completing my university studies and devoting all my free time to studying Frontend Development, as I'm really interested in it. I consider web-development as a promising area of user-centric development. I enjoy implementing both small features and entire applications, as well as tidying up the code. I am currently in the process of improving my skills to get a job as a JS developer.*
